# Advanced Analysis

## Overview

The advanced analysis module incorporates sophisticated techniques including language model integration, aggregate impact assessment, and tipping point identification to provide deep insights into climate risks.

## Key Functions

### `conduct_advanced_risk_analysis(risks: List[Risk], scenarios: Dict[str, Scenario], company_industry: str, key_dependencies: List[str], external_data: Dict) -> Dict`

Performs comprehensive risk analysis using various advanced techniques.

### `llm_risk_assessment(risk: Risk, scenario: Scenario, company_industry: str) -> str`

Uses a language model to provide detailed analysis of how a specific risk's likelihood and impact may change under a given scenario.

### `generate_risk_narratives(risks: List[Risk], comprehensive_analysis: Dict[str, Dict[int, str]]) -> Dict[int, str]`

Generates narrative summaries for each risk across all scenarios.

### `generate_executive_insights(comprehensive_analysis: Dict[str, Dict[int, str]], risks: List[Risk]) -> str`

Generates high-level executive insights based on the comprehensive analysis.

### `generate_mitigation_strategies(risks: List[Risk], comprehensive_analysis: Dict[str, Dict[int, str]]) -> Dict[int, List[str]]`

Generates specific mitigation strategies for each risk based on the comprehensive analysis.

### `assess_aggregate_impact(risks: List[Risk], interaction_matrix: np.ndarray, num_simulations: int = 1000) -> Dict[str, float]`

Assesses the aggregate impact of all risks, considering their interactions.

### `identify_tipping_points(risks: List[Risk], interaction_matrix: np.ndarray) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

Identifies potential tipping points where small changes in risk levels could lead to significant overall impacts.

## Usage Example

```python
# Load data
risks = load_risk_data('data/risk_data.csv')
external_data = load_external_data('data/external_data.csv')
scenarios = load_scenarios()

# Conduct advanced analysis
advanced_analysis = conduct_advanced_risk_analysis(risks, scenarios, "Energy", ["Oil suppliers", "Renewable energy"], external_data)

# Generate risk narratives
risk_narratives = generate_risk_narratives(risks, advanced_analysis['comprehensive_analysis'])

# Generate executive insights
executive_insights = generate_executive_insights(advanced_analysis['comprehensive_analysis'], risks)

# Generate mitigation strategies
mitigation_strategies = generate_mitigation_strategies(risks, advanced_analysis['comprehensive_analysis'])

# Assess aggregate impact
interaction_matrix = create_risk_interaction_matrix(risks)
aggregate_impact = assess_aggregate_impact(risks, interaction_matrix)

# Identify tipping points
tipping_points = identify_tipping_points(risks, interaction_matrix)
```

## Key Considerations

- The module leverages language models for sophisticated risk assessment and narrative generation.
- Aggregate impact assessment considers the complex interactions between risks.
- Tipping point identification helps in understanding potential non-linear effects in the risk landscape.
- Executive insights and mitigation strategies provide actionable information for decision-makers.

## Customization

You can customize the advanced analysis by modifying the following in `src/config.py`:

- `LLM_MODEL`: Specify the language model used for advanced analysis
- `LLM_API_KEY`: Set the API key for accessing the language model
- `AGGREGATE_IMPACT_SIMULATIONS`: Set the number of simulations for aggregate impact assessment

## Integration with Other Modules

The advanced analysis module integrates closely with other modules:

- It uses the scenario definitions from the scenario analysis module.
- It incorporates results from the interaction analysis module.
- Its outputs are used in the reporting module to generate comprehensive reports.
