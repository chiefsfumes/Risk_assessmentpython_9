# Risk Analysis

## Overview

The risk analysis module is the core of the Climate Risk Assessment Tool. It encompasses various analytical techniques to evaluate and understand climate-related risks.

## Key Components

### 1. Risk Categorization

#### `categorize_risks(risks: List[Risk]) -> Dict[str, List[Risk]]`

Categorizes risks based on their primary category.

#### `categorize_risks_multi_level(risks: List[Risk]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, List[Risk]]]`

Categorizes risks based on their primary and secondary categories.

#### `prioritize_risks(risks: List[Risk]) -> Dict[str, List[Risk]]`

Prioritizes risks based on their impact and likelihood.

### 2. PESTEL Analysis

#### `perform_pestel_analysis(risks: List[Risk], external_data: Dict[str, ExternalData]) -> Dict[str, List[Dict[str, str]]]`

Performs a PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal) analysis of the risks.

### 3. SASB Integration

#### `integrate_sasb_materiality(risks: List[Risk], industry: str) -> Dict[str, List[Risk]]`

Integrates Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality assessment for industry-specific risks.

### 4. Advanced Analysis

#### `conduct_advanced_risk_analysis(risks: List[Risk], scenarios: Dict[str, Scenario], company_industry: str, key_dependencies: List[str], external_data: Dict) -> Dict`

Performs comprehensive risk analysis using various techniques including LLM-based assessments, interaction analysis, and more.

### 5. Systemic Risk Analysis

#### `analyze_systemic_risks(risks: List[Risk], company_industry: str, key_dependencies: List[str]) -> Dict[int, SystemicRisk]`

Analyzes systemic risks and their potential cascading effects.

#### `identify_trigger_points(risks: List[Risk], risk_network: nx.Graph, external_data: Dict[str, ExternalData]) -> Dict[int, Dict]`

Identifies potential trigger points that could lead to systemic risk events.

#### `assess_system_resilience(risks: List[Risk], risk_network: nx.Graph, scenario_impacts: Dict[str, List[Tuple[Risk, float]]]) -> Dict[str, float]`

Assesses the overall resilience of the system to climate risks.

## Usage Example

```python
# Load data
risks = load_risk_data('data/risk_data.csv')
external_data = load_external_data('data/external_data.csv')

# Perform basic risk analysis
categorized_risks = categorize_risks(risks)
prioritized_risks = prioritize_risks(risks)

# Perform PESTEL analysis
pestel_analysis = perform_pestel_analysis(risks, external_data)

# Integrate SASB materiality
industry_specific_risks = integrate_sasb_materiality(risks, 'Energy')

# Conduct advanced analysis
advanced_analysis = conduct_advanced_risk_analysis(risks, SCENARIOS, "Energy", ["Oil suppliers", "Renewable energy"], external_data)

# Analyze systemic risks
systemic_risks = analyze_systemic_risks(risks, "Energy", ["Oil suppliers", "Renewable energy"])
trigger_points = identify_trigger_points(risks, risk_network, external_data)
resilience_assessment = assess_system_resilience(risks, risk_network, scenario_impacts)
```

## Key Considerations

- The advanced analysis integrates machine learning and natural language processing techniques for more sophisticated risk assessment.
- Systemic risk analysis considers the interconnectedness of risks and potential cascading effects.
- The PESTEL analysis and SASB integration provide broader context and industry-specific insights.
- All analyses consider multiple scenarios to account for different possible future states.
