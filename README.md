## Overview

This advanced climate risk assessment tool is designed to provide businesses and industries with in-depth insights into climate-related risks. By leveraging cutting-edge analytics, machine learning algorithms, and scenario analysis, it offers a holistic view of potential climate risks across physical, transition, nature, and systemic risk cascades.

## Customization Options

### Scenario Modification
To define custom climate scenarios:

1. Open `src/config.py`
2. Locate the `SCENARIOS` dictionary
3. Add or modify scenarios using the following structure:

```python
SCENARIOS = {
    "Custom Scenario": Scenario(
        name="Custom Scenario",
        temp_increase=2.0,
        carbon_price=150,
        renewable_energy=0.6,
        policy_stringency=0.7,
        biodiversity_loss=0.2,
        ecosystem_degradation=0.3,
        financial_stability=0.7,
        supply_chain_disruption=0.4
    ),
    # ... other scenarios ...
}
```

### Risk Parameters
To fine-tune risk calculations:

1. Navigate to the relevant file in `src/risk_analysis/`
2. Modify the calculation functions. For example, in `scenario_analysis.py`:

```python
def calculate_risk_impact(risk: Risk, external_data: Dict[str, ExternalData], scenario: Scenario) -> float:
    base_impact = risk.impact
    temp_factor = 1 + (scenario.temp_increase - 1.5) * 0.12  # Increased from 0.1 to 0.12
    # ... other factors ...
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, impact))
```

### Reporting Customization
To customize report output:

1. Open `src/reporting.py` or `src/reporting/stakeholder_reports.py`
2. Modify the report generation functions. For example:

```python
def generate_executive_summary(risks: List[Risk], scenario_impacts: Dict[str, List[Tuple[Risk, float]]]) -> str:
    summary = f"This assessment identified {len(risks)} climate risks, with {sum(1 for r in risks if r.impact > 0.7)} high-impact risks.\n\n"
    summary += "Top 3 risks by impact:\n"
    for risk in sorted(risks, key=lambda r: r.impact, reverse=True)[:3]:
        summary += f"- {risk.description} (Impact: {risk.impact:.2f})\n"
    # ... additional custom content ...
    return summary
```

### Visualization Customization
To adjust plot styles and types:

1. Open `src/visualization.py`
2. Modify the visualization functions. For example:

```python
def risk_matrix(risks: List[Risk]):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    plt.scatter([r.likelihood for r in risks], [r.impact for r in risks], s=100, c='red', alpha=0.7)
    plt.xlabel('Likelihood')
    plt.ylabel('Impact')
    plt.title('Risk Matrix', fontsize=16)
    # ... additional customization ...
    plt.savefig(os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'custom_risk_matrix.png'), dpi=300)
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

[Detailed testing and quality assurance information]

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure your input data is as accurate and up-to-date as possible. The quality of the assessment depends heavily on the quality of input data.

2. **Scenario Planning**: Develop a range of plausible scenarios that cover both optimistic and pessimistic futures. This will provide a more comprehensive view of potential risks.

3. **Regular Updates**: Climate science and regulations evolve rapidly. Update your risk assessments at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in your industry or the global climate landscape.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve various departments and external experts in the risk identification and assessment process to capture a wide range of perspectives.

5. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Regularly perform sensitivity analyses on key parameters to understand which factors have the most significant impact on your risk profile.

6. **Integration with Business Strategy**: Use the insights from the risk assessment to inform your overall business strategy, not just as a standalone exercise.

7. **Continuous Learning**: Stay informed about the latest developments in climate science, policy, and risk assessment methodologies. Continuously improve your assessment process.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **OpenAI API Key Error**
   - Issue: `openai.error.AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key provided`
   - Solution: Double-check that you've correctly set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

2. **Data Loading Errors**
   - Issue: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/risk_data.csv'`
   - Solution: Ensure that all required data files are present in the `data/` directory and have the correct names.

3. **Visualization Errors**
   - Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'`
   - Solution: Make sure you've installed all required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
   - Issue: `MemoryError` when processing large amounts of data
   - Solution: Consider using data sampling techniques or processing data in batches. You may also need to increase your system's RAM.
