# Risk Analysis V2

## Overview

The risk analysis module is the core of the Climate Risk Assessment Tool. It encompasses various analytical techniques to evaluate and understand climate-related risks.

## Categorization

### `categorize_risks(risks: List[Risk]) -> Dict[str, List[Risk]]`

This function categorizes risks based on their primary category.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.

#### Output
- A dictionary with risk categories as keys and lists of corresponding `Risk` objects as values.

### `categorize_risks_multi_level(risks: List[Risk]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, List[Risk]]]`

This function categorizes risks based on their primary and secondary categories.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.

#### Output
- A nested dictionary with primary categories as outer keys, secondary categories as inner keys, and lists of corresponding `Risk` objects as values.

### `prioritize_risks(risks: List[Risk]) -> Dict[str, List[Risk]]`

This function prioritizes risks based on their impact and likelihood.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.

#### Output
- A dictionary with priority levels ("High", "Medium", "Low") as keys and lists of corresponding `Risk` objects as values.

## Advanced Analysis

### `conduct_advanced_risk_analysis(risks: List[Risk], scenarios: Dict[str, Scenario], company_industry: str, key_dependencies: List[str], external_data: Dict) -> Dict`

This function performs a comprehensive risk analysis using various techniques including LLM-based assessments, interaction analysis, and more.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.
- `scenarios`: A dictionary of `Scenario` objects.
- `company_industry`: A string representing the company's industry.
- `key_dependencies`: A list of strings representing key dependencies.
- `external_data`: A dictionary of external data.

#### Output
- A dictionary containing various analysis results, including comprehensive analysis, risk narratives, executive insights, systemic risks, and more.

## Scenario Analysis

### `simulate_scenario_impact(risks: List[Risk], external_data: Dict[str, ExternalData], scenario: Scenario) -> List[Tuple[Risk, float]]`

This function simulates the impact of a given scenario on the provided risks.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.
- `external_data`: A dictionary of `ExternalData` objects.
- `scenario`: A `Scenario` object representing the scenario to simulate.

#### Output
- A list of tuples, each containing a `Risk` object and its simulated impact under the given scenario.

### `monte_carlo_simulation(risks: List[Risk], external_data: Dict[str, ExternalData], scenarios: Dict[str, Scenario]) -> Dict[str, Dict[int, SimulationResult]]`

This function performs Monte Carlo simulations for each risk under different scenarios.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.
- `external_data`: A dictionary of `ExternalData` objects.
- `scenarios`: A dictionary of `Scenario` objects.

#### Output
- A nested dictionary with scenarios as outer keys, risk IDs as inner keys, and `SimulationResult` objects as values.

## Interaction Analysis

### `analyze_risk_interactions(risks: List[Risk]) -> List[RiskInteraction]`

This function analyzes the interactions between different risks using LLM.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.

#### Output
- A list of `RiskInteraction` objects representing the interactions between risks.

### `build_risk_network(risks: List[Risk], interactions: List[RiskInteraction]) -> nx.Graph`

This function builds a network graph of risk interactions.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.
- `interactions`: A list of `RiskInteraction` objects.

#### Output
- A NetworkX Graph object representing the risk interaction network.

### `identify_central_risks(G: nx.Graph) -> Dict[int, float]`

This function identifies central risks in the risk network.

#### Input
- `G`: A NetworkX Graph object representing the risk network.

#### Output
- A dictionary with risk IDs as keys and centrality scores as values.

## Time Series Analysis

### `time_series_analysis(risks: List[Risk], external_data: Dict[str, ExternalData]) -> Dict[int, List[float]]`

This function performs time series analysis on the risks using historical external data.

#### Input
- `risks`: A list of `Risk` objects.
- `external_data`: A dictionary of `ExternalData` objects.

#### Output
- A dictionary with risk IDs as keys and lists of projected impact values as values.

By leveraging these various analysis techniques, the Climate Risk Assessment Tool provides a comprehensive understanding of potential climate-related risks, their interactions, and their behavior under different scenarios.
